Mind Dump is a student wellness app within a safe anonymous space that is designed to help users vent, reflect, and thus feel emotionally supported. The app was developed because more students experienced academic stress, burnout, also emotional isolation. Mind Dump, unlike customary social platforms, lets users have freedom to express feelings, track their current mood, and also receive supportive reactions in just a private outlet that is all without judgment or exposure. For students coping with daily stressors, this project seeks to create a tool. The tool encourages emotional release, also self-awareness, and mental clarity.
